How to Run

First, you need to install VirtualBox and Vagrant on your machine.

Then, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine.

Go to the vagrant directory in the cloned repository, then open a terminal window and type $ vagrant up to launch your virtual machine. This will take some time in your first run, because it needs to install some dependencies.

Once it is up and running, type $ vagrant ssh to log into it. This will log your terminal in to the virtual machine, and you'll get a Linux shell prompt.

Open the app.py file in nd_sharables directory, you'll see an instruction on how to register this app on GitHub and obtain Client ID.

Once you've registered the app and set Client ID/Secret in the app.py file, you are now ready to launch the app.

On your virtual machine, go to /vagrant/nd_sharables directory, then type $ python app.py. This will launch the application.

You can check out the page from your browser at http://localhost:8000.
